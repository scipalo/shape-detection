# shape-detection
Topology shape detection project for university class

Program takes obj files, makes Vietoris-Rips simplicial complexes
and compute betti numbers for different distances (epsilons). 
Extracts correct betti number for choosen model (based on timeline
and persistance of betti numbers for certain epsilon).
Determines wich simple shape choosen model is.

Models: line, plane, circle, sphere, torus

Parameters to set: file names, distance (epsilon) for computing VR
